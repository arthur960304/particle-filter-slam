Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using Particle Filter

This project aims to simultaneously localize a walking humanoid robot and map an unknown indoor environment using odometry data, IMU orientation and a 2D laser range scanner (LIDAR). A particle filter based approach is taken to achieve the objective.
